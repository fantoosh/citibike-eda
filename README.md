# Exploratory analysis of Citi Bike data from 2014 to 2016

## by Charles Ikenna Abara

## Citi bike dataset

This study utilizes data from a bike-sharing system in multiple locations in the New York City area, including Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Jersey City. The data includes information on individual bike rides and is divided into monthly reports. The data for all months will be merged into a single dataframe for analysis. Information about the data can be found [here](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data).

## Summary of Findings:

- During the univariate analysis of the data, we found that there were more short bike rides than long rides. We also identified the 20
  most popular stations among Citi Bike users. In addition, our analysis showed that the majority of rides occurred during the day, with
  Sunday having the fewest number of rides and Wednesday having the most.

- The Bivariate analysis examined the relationship between ride duration and various factors such as gender and user type. Our findings indicated that subscribers with 24-hour or 3-day passes tended to take shorter rides compared to those with annual subscriptions.

- The Multivariate analysis further explored the effects of gender and user type on ride duration.

## Key insights for presentation:

In the presentation of our findings, the goal is to clearly communicate the results of our exploratory analysis to the audience. To achieve this, we will include key insights such as the distribution of ride duration, the hourly ride duration broken down by gender and user type, and the monthly ride counts for each gender and user type. Through these insights, we hope to provide a deeper understanding of Citi Bike users' ride patterns and the impact of gender and user type on these patterns.

# Citibike Exploratory Analysis
## by Charles Ikenna Abara


## citi bike dataset

This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Jersey City. Information about the data can be found [here](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data). I will be working with citibike data from 2014 to 2016. The data is divided into monthly operation reports. I will be working with citibike data from 2014 to 2016. The data is divided into monthly operation reports. The data for all months will be loaded and merged into one dataframe. 


## Summary of Findings

> **Univariate Exploration:**<br>
Univariate exploration of the dataset showed that there were more short bike rides than long rides. I also filtered out the 20 most popular stations. My analysis revealed that most users take trips during the day and that Sunday had the least rides while Wednesday had the most.


> **Bivariate Exploration:**<br>
Bivariate data analysis on the dataset revealed the effect of users' gender and user type on ride duration. It revealed that Subscribers with 24-hours passes or 3-day passes took shorter rides when compared with customers with annual subscriptions. 

> **Multivariate Exploration:**<br>
My multivariate analysis delved further into the effects of gender and user type on duration.


## Key Insights for Presentation

The goal of the presentation is to communicate the findings of my exploratory analysis. This slide will give insight into Citi bikers' ride patterns and the effect of gender and user type on bike rides and ride duration.  My Explanatory Analysis will include a density destribution of duration, a pointplot of duration per hour for each gender, pointplot of duration per hour for each user type, Rides per month for each gender and Rides per month for each user type.
